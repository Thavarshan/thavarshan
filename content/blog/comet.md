# Comet: A Free, Cross-Platform Video Converter Powered by FFmpeg

## The Story Behind Comet: Solving My Own Problem

It all started with a simple need: I had a folder full of video files in various formats that I needed to convert to MP4 so I could watch them on my TV. As anyone in my situation would do, I turned to the internet in search of a free, easy-to-use video converter that could handle bulk file conversions.

But to my surprise, finding a solution wasn't as easy as I had hoped. Sure, there were plenty of video converters out there, but they all seemed to have some sort of catch—either they were riddled with ads, imposed restrictive limitations, required expensive subscriptions, or, worst of all, they bundled in unwanted software.

Frustrated, I thought to myself: *Is it really this hard to find a simple, free tool that just works?* That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands.

## The First Step: Writing a Shell Script

Given my background in programming, I knew there was a reliable tool out there that could handle video conversions: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia framework that can decode, encode, transcode, and stream multimedia files in a variety of formats. It's the backbone of many video conversion tools, and best of all—it's free and open-source.

So, I rolled up my sleeves and wrote a shell script that utilized FFmpeg to convert all the video files in a folder from one format to another. The script worked beautifully, converting all my files with ease, and it was fast too. No ads, no limitations—just pure, raw power at my fingertips.

But as much as I loved my script, I realized it wasn't exactly the most user-friendly solution. I knew that not everyone was comfortable working in a terminal, and I wanted to share this powerful tool with others in a way that was accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

## The Birth of Comet

That's when the idea for **Comet** was born.

I set out to create a cross-platform desktop application that would harness the power of FFmpeg but wrap it in a beautiful, user-friendly interface that anyone could use. I wanted Comet to be more than just another video converter—I wanted it to be the video converter that I had been searching for all along.

Comet is designed to be free, easy to use, and visually appealing. Whether you're looking to convert a single file or perform bulk conversions, Comet makes the process as simple as dragging and dropping your files, choosing your desired format, and hitting "Convert." No ads, no hidden fees—just a powerful tool that does exactly what you need it to do.

## The Current State: Join the Journey

Comet is still in development, but we've already made great strides. The basic UI is in place, and we've implemented features like bulk file uploads and customizable output settings. But there's still more to do, and this is where you come in.

We're looking for contributors and collaborators who share our vision of creating a truly free, user-friendly video converter. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there's a place for you in this project. Together, we can build something that not only solves our own problems but also helps countless others who are in search of a reliable video conversion tool.

## Closing Thoughts

It's funny how a simple need can turn into a passion project. What started as a shell script for personal use is now growing into a full-fledged application that, I hope, will make video conversion easier for everyone.

So, here's to solving our own problems—and sharing those solutions with the world.
