title: "Meet phpvm: Your New PHP Best Friend Forever!"
description: "Picture this, You're working on a legacy project that runs on PHP 7.2, but your shiny new side project is built on PHP 8.1. Normally, this would be the part where you pull your hair out and question your life choices. But not anymore! Enter phpvm, your new PHP version management bestie."

## What's the Big Deal?

phpvm is like a magic wand for PHP versions. With just a few simple commands, you can:

- Install multiple PHP versions faster than you can say "Laravel"
- Switch between PHP versions smoother than a barista makes a latte
- Manage your PHP versions like a boss, without breaking a sweat

## How to Get This Magic in Your Life

Getting started with phpvm is easier than explaining why you need another JavaScript framework. Just run this command:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thavarshan/phpvm/0.0.1/bin/install.sh | bash
```

Or if you're more of a wget person:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thavarshan/phpvm/0.0.1/bin/install | bash
```

And voilà! You're ready to rock the PHP version management world!

## Let's See This Baby in Action!

Want to install PHP 8.1? Easy peasy:

```bash
phpvm install 8.1
```

Need to switch to PHP 7.4 for that legacy project? No problemo:

```bash
phpvm use 7.4
```

Want to see all your installed PHP versions? We've got you covered:

```bash
phpvm list
```

It's so simple, even your cat could do it (if they had opposable thumbs, that is).
